 *   v2: ST7123 panel + ST7123 touch (auto-detected by I2C probe)
 *
 * All panel + power-rail bring-up is handled by the upstream
 * espressif/m5stack_tab5 BSP managed component, which is pulled in
 * by components/display/idf_component.yml for the esp32p4 target.
 * That includes:
 *   - PI4IOE5V6408 I/O expander (I2C addr 0x43 / 0x44) that drives
 *     LCD_EN (IO4) and TOUCH_EN (IO5) power rails;
 *   - MIPI-DSI PHY LDO power-up;
 *   - the ILI9881C / ST7123 init data blocks;
 *   - LEDC PWM backlight on GPIO22.
 *
 * Pins listed below are the ones Draftling itself touches outside
 * of the BSP (SD card, shared I2C bus carrying the GT911 touch).

/* M5Stack Tab5 touch controller. Two hardware variants exist:
 *
 *   - v1: Goodix GT911 capacitive touch at I2C 0x14 (backup
 *         address). RST is not wired to any ESP32-P4 GPIO, so
 *         the GT911 internal POR is triggered by power-cycling
 *         BSP_TOUCH_EN through the first PI4IOE5V6408. main.cpp
 *         pre-drives GPIO23 LOW (overriding the 3V3 pull-up on
 *         INT) before that toggle so the GT911 latches its
 *         backup address rather than the unused 0x5D.
 *
 *   - v2: Sitronix ST7123 integrated panel+touch at I2C 0x55.
 *         No INT-latch dance is needed.
 *
 * Rather than re-implement the per-variant bring-up, the
 * Draftling touchscreen component delegates to the upstream
 * espressif/m5stack_tab5 BSP's bsp_touch_new() on this board.
 * The BSP probes 0x55 first (ST7123, board v2) and falls back
 * to 0x14 backup (GT911, board v1), instantiates the matching
 * esp_lcd_touch_* driver, and returns a generic
 * esp_lcd_touch_handle_t. touchscreen.cpp polls through
 * esp_lcd_touch_read_data + esp_lcd_touch_get_coordinates so
 * the same source handles both variants transparently. The
 * pre-display TOUCH_EN power-cycle in main.cpp still runs (it
 * is the only thing that fixes the v1 GT911 address latch).
 *
 * TOUCH_I2C_ADDR / TOUCH_RST_PIN below are kept as nominal
 * (v1 GT911) values for the legacy touchscreen_config_t struct;
 * the BSP path ignores them and uses BSP_LCD_TOUCH_INT for INT
 * and GPIO_NUM_NC for RST. Native panel coordinate range is
 * 720 x 1280 portrait (matches BSP_LCD_H_RES / BSP_LCD_V_RES).
 *
 * draftling_lvgl_port_init() is called with the user-configured
 * DISPLAY_ROTATE (default 270 for landscape) and LVGL v9.2 then
 * rotates indev points itself inside indev_pointer_proc(). So
 * touchscreen.cpp must hand LVGL coords in the *pre-rotation*
 * portrait frame -- main.cpp passes user_rotate_deg=0 for that
 * reason. Empirically (Tab5 v1, GT911 via BSP), the controller's
 * native axes are inverted on both axes relative to the panel's
 * portrait pixel axes: a tap at landscape upper-left produces
 * raw_x near 0 (small end of the 0..720 short-axis range) and
 * raw_y near 1280 (large end of the long-axis range), which
 * corresponds to panel-native portrait corner (0, 1280-ish) --
 * the opposite portrait corner from what LVGL's rotation-270
 * indev transform expects for landscape (0, 0). Mirroring both
 * X and Y in native_to_logical() flips raw onto panel-native
 * portrait so LVGL's own indev rotation lands the cursor under
 * the finger. */
