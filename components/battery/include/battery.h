 * Battery monitor.
 *
 * Two backends are exposed:
 *
 *   - ADC + resistive divider (battery_init): used on boards that
 *     wire the LiPo cell through a divider into an ESP32-S3 ADC1 pin
 *     (Waveshare ESP32-S3-RLCD-4.2, M5Stack PaperS3,
 *     Waveshare Touch-LCD-3.49). Voltage maps
 *     to percentage via a fixed 5-step LiPo discharge table:
 *       >= 4.10 V -> 100 %  (full)
 *       >= 3.95 V ->  75 %
 *       >= 3.80 V ->  50 %
 *       >= 3.60 V ->  25 %
 *       <  3.60 V ->   0 %  (empty)
 *     Readings are smoothed with an exponential moving average over
 *     8 samples to reduce ADC noise.
 *
 *   - TI BQ27220 fuel gauge over I2C (battery_init_bq27220): used on
 *     boards that route the cell through a dedicated coulomb counter
 *     (LilyGO T5 E-Paper S3 Pro / Pro Lite). The percentage comes
 *     straight from the gauge's StateOfCharge register and does not
 *     need software smoothing or a voltage-to-percent table.
 */

/*
 * Initialize the ADC for battery voltage measurement.
 * Must be called once before any other battery_* function.
 *
 *   gpio_num     -- ADC1 GPIO connected to the divider output
 *   enable_gpio  -- GPIO that powers the divider, or -1 if always on
 *   divider      -- multiplier from measured pin voltage back to the
 *                   battery voltage. Use 2 for a balanced 1:1 divider
 *                   (R_top == R_bottom, V_pin = V_bat / 2) and 3 for
 *                   a 2:1 divider where R_top is twice R_bottom
 *                   (V_pin = V_bat / 3).

 * Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure. After a successful call,
 * `battery_read_mv()` reports the cell voltage in millivolts and
 * `battery_read_percent()` reports the StateOfCharge register
 * (0x2C) directly.
 *
 * Used on boards that route the LiPo cell through a TI BQ27220
 * coulomb counter on I2C (addr 0x55) instead of a GPIO ADC divider,

 *   cells          -- number of Li-ion cells in series the INA226

 *
 * Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure. After a successful
 * call, `battery_read_mv()` reports the per-cell voltage (so the
 * existing 3.0-4.2 V LiPo mapping in mv_to_percent() applies
 * regardless of `cells`) and `battery_read_percent()` runs that
 * voltage through the same lookup table the ADC backend uses.
 *
 * The INA226 has no SoC / coulomb-count state, so percentage is
 * voltage-derived and approximate.

/*
 * Initialize the TI BQ25896 single-cell Li-ion charger on an existing
 * I2C master bus (driver/i2c_master.h). This is a charger, not a
 * monitor: it does not change what battery_read_mv() /
 * battery_read_percent() return. Calling it is independent of the
 * monitor backend selection (the LilyGO T5 E-Paper S3 Pro uses the
 * BQ27220 fuel gauge for SoC and the BQ25896 for charging on the
 * same I2C bus).
 *
 *   i2c_master_bus -- opaque pointer to an i2c_master_bus_handle_t.
 *
 * The default BQ25896 power-on configuration is conservative:
 * IINLIM defaults to 500 mA (USB SDP), AUTO_DPDM is enabled (so a
 * fresh D+/D- detection on every plug-in keeps resetting IINLIM
 * back to 500 mA when no host is present), and the I2C watchdog
 * times out after 40 s and reverts any host-written settings. The
 * net effect on boards like the LilyGO T5 E-Paper S3 Pro is that
 * the cell only ever charges at ~500 mA regardless of what the
 * adapter can deliver.
 *
 * This routine fixes that by:
 *   - disabling the source-detection state machine in REG02
 *     (ICO_EN, HVDCP_EN, MAXC_EN, AUTO_DPDM_EN all cleared) so the
 *     Input Current Optimizer cannot silently clamp the actual input
 *     limit (IDPM_LIM) below IINLIM after detecting VBUS sag, no
 *     QC/MaxCharge handshakes are attempted, and re-plug does not
 *     snap IINLIM back to the USB-SDP 500 mA default,
 *   - raising IINLIM to 2000 mA and clearing EN_ILIM (REG00 bit 6)
 *     so the register value is the sole input-current ceiling -- the
 *     on-board ILIM resistor on the LilyGO T5 is sized for ~500 mA
 *     and would otherwise clip the 2 A request,
 *   - raising the fast-charge current ICHG to 1024 mA (0.5C for a
 *     ~2 Ah cell),
 *   - forcing VINDPM to an absolute 3.9 V (REG0D bit 7 = 1) so the
 *     chip cannot throttle input current to hold VBUS up when a
 *     thin USB cable sags -- the relative-VINDPM POR default
 *     latches at ~4.4 V on a 5 V brick and otherwise crawls in
 *     at ~0.11 A regardless of IINLIM, and
 *   - disabling the I2C watchdog so the above settings persist.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, non-zero if the chip is not present or any
 * I2C write fails.
