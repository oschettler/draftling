/*
 * USB HID keyboard host.
 *
 * Brings up the ESP-IDF USB Host stack + espressif/usb_host_hid HID
 * driver, opens any attached USB HID keyboard interface in boot
 * protocol mode, and translates boot keyboard reports into the same
 * kb_event_t event stream emitted by the ble_keyboard component.
 *
 * Designed as a sibling to ble_keyboard: callers wire the same
 * editor key-handler into both via *_set_callback(), and pick which
 * radio to bring up based on usb_kbd_is_connected() (USB keyboard
 * physically attached at boot time wins -- BLE pairing is not even
 * started).
 *
 * Currently used on the M5Stack Tab5, whose USB-A connector is
 * exposed through the espressif/m5stack_tab5 BSP. The BSP power
 * gate (BSP_FEATURE_USB on PI4IOE5V6408 #2) must be enabled
 * BEFORE usb_kbd_init() -- main.cpp does this via
 * bsp_usb_host_start().
