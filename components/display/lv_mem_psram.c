/*
 * LVGL custom memory allocator that routes lv_malloc/lv_free through
 * ESP heap_caps allocators with MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM, so LVGL widgets,
 * styles, and other small allocations land in PSRAM instead of the
 * scarce internal DRAM.
 *
 * Activated by CONFIG_LV_USE_CUSTOM_MALLOC=y in sdkconfig.defaults.
 * When that Kconfig is set, LVGL compiles its built-in TLSF allocator
 * out (#if LV_USE_STDLIB_MALLOC == LV_STDLIB_BUILTIN) and links these
 * symbols instead. Without this file the build would fail with
 * undefined references to lv_malloc_core / lv_free_core / etc.
 *
 * This translation unit is injected directly into the lvgl__lvgl
 * managed-component library by components/display/CMakeLists.txt
 * (idf_component_get_property + target_sources) so that the symbols
 * end up in the same static archive (liblvgl__lvgl.a) as the
 * lv_mem.c references. Compiling it as part of libdisplay.a turned
 * out to be fragile: with archives in a single --start-group the
 * linker is supposed to find it, but in practice the display archive
 * was sometimes processed before lvgl__lvgl's unresolved lv_*_core
 * references were scanned, leaving them undefined at final link.
 *
 * Why this matters
 * ----------------
 * On the M5Stack PaperS3 (8 MB PSRAM) the M5GFX framebuffer (~253 KB),
 * Bluedroid host, WiFi static RX buffers, and LVGL all compete for
 * ~190 KB of internal DRAM. Before this change LVGL kept its own 64 KB
 * TLSF pool as a static array in .bss (DRAM); after this change that
 * pool is gone and every lv_malloc call goes straight to PSRAM.
 *
 * heap_caps_realloc with a NULL pointer behaves like heap_caps_malloc,
 * and heap_caps_free of NULL is a no-op, matching the malloc/free
 * contract LVGL expects.
