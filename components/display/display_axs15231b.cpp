/*
 * AXS15231B QSPI color-LCD driver.
 *
 * Used by:
 *   - Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-3.49 (640x172)
 *   - Guition JC3248W535               (480x320)
 *
 * The AXS15231B is a small color TFT controller that uses a 4-line
 * (Quad-SPI) interface for both commands and pixel data. Commands
 * are sent in single-line mode wrapped in a 32-bit "address phase"
 * preamble (0x02, 0x00, cmd, 0x00) and pixel writes are sent in QSPI
 * mode after a (0x32, 0x00, 0x2C, 0x00) preamble that selects the
 * controller's "Memory Write" command (0x2C).
 *
 * Architecture
 * ------------
 * Unlike the monochrome backends, this driver keeps its own RGB565
 * framebuffer in PSRAM (sized to width * height * 2). The LVGL
 * port's flush_cb pushes RGB565 rectangles into the framebuffer via
 * display_push_rgb565(), and display_flush() walks the accumulated
 * dirty bounding box and DMA-streams just that region to the panel
 * over QSPI. There is no per-pixel display_set_pixel fast-path on
 * color hardware (the LVGL port always takes the RGB565 path), but
 * we provide a degraded fallback that interprets 0/0xFF as
 * black/white in case the framebuffer is queried from elsewhere
 * (e.g. the splash-screen logo in editor_ui.cpp).
 *
 * Status
 * ------
 * Driver protocol implementation cross-referenced against the
 * Arduino_GFX Arduino_ESP32QSPI / Arduino_AXS15231B references and
 * corrected on real hardware (Guition JC3248W535): vendor commands
 * are sent with the cmd/addr phases on all 4 data lines
 * (SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_CMD|_ADDR), the QSPI memory-write opcode
 * uses operand 0x3C (not the MIPI 0x2C), and pixel-write bursts
 * keep CS low across all chunks (preamble on the first chunk only,
 * zero-bit cmd/addr/dummy on continuation chunks). The init
 * sequence is the proven Arduino_GFX "Type-1" 320x480 vendor
 * block.
 *
 * Pins are passed in via display_axs15231b_init() (struct-based,
 * since the controller needs 9 GPIOs -- more than the legacy
 * display_init() can carry). Call display_axs15231b_init() from
 * main.cpp; the legacy display_init() is unsupported on this
 * backend and will abort.

 *     on all four data lines (SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_CMD|_ADDR), or

 *
 *   - Pixel writes (memory-write):
 *       cmd byte = 0x32   (QSPI "memory write" opcode)
 *       addr     = 0x00 0x3C 0x00   (NB: 0x3C, not the MIPI 0x2C)
 *       data     = raw RGB565 pixels in QSPI (4-line) mode

 *     pixel bytes with zero-bit cmd/addr/dummy phases. CS must
 *     stay LOW across the whole burst -- if CS toggles between

 * Continue, RAMWRC) for a write that continues from the current
 * pointer position. Both work on this controller but they have
 * very different semantics:
 *   RAMWR  (0x2C) -- anchors the write pointer at (CASET_x_start, 0)
 *                    every time, so a flush that streams a full panel
 *                    worth of pixels always covers the entire frame
 *                    deterministically.
 *   RAMWRC (0x3C) -- picks up from wherever the pointer happens to

 * relied on RASET to set the row window, which the controller
 * silently ignores over QSPI (see set_addr_window comments and
 * thingsapart/esp32_lcd_controllers axs15231b_panel.c). The combination
